How to translate NativeCAM in your own language

Required : poedit

Create a sub-directory in locale dir and name it with the 2 letters code for your language
create a sub-directory in this new directory and name it 'LC_MESSAGES'
copy locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/nativecam.po into this new sub-directory (this file has nothing translate but all the strings of nativecam)

Open the file with poedit
Select a line and right click on it to see the source
Open it to learn if it is a label/name or tool_tip and the context
A label/name should be translated with a short string to fit in the column 'Name' of the treeview
A tool_tip does not have this problem but keep the same format, best by copying to the translation before editing

Testing in NativeCAM
open a terminal in ncam directory
enter 'export NATIVECAM_LOCALE="full path to locale subdirectory"' ex: '/home/dave/ncam/locale'
enter 'export LANGUAGE=??' your 2 letters code for your language
enter ./ncam.py

There are about 875 strings to translate, do not care about 'lathe' stuff because they all have to be redone
Be patient, it will take about 12 hours for the first pass, then 2-4 for testing

When you have started the project, you should let me know on lcnc forum to avoid someone else doing the same task as you

When you are satisfied, please let me know and submit your nativecam.po
It will be included as your contribution
